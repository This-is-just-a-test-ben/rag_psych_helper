# RAG-based AI Assistant: Psychology Helper

This project is part of the Agentic AI Developer Certification (AAIDC) Module 1. It implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using ChromaDB, SentenceTransformers, and OpenAI’s GPT model to answer questions based on a local corpus of psychology-related documents, specifically Organizational Psychology, Methodology, and Survey Design.

## Target Audience

This assistant is ideal for:
- Students and early-career researchers in psychology
- Practitioners in behavioral science or workforce development
- Anyone interested in building AI tools for grounded question answering

## Project Overview

1. Load & Chunk: Local `.txt` files are recursively loaded and chunked with LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
2. Embed & Store: Chunks are embedded using SentenceTransformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and stored in ChromaDB.
3. Query & Retrieve: The assistant embeds your natural language query and retrieves the top relevant chunks.
4. Generate Answer: A system prompt is created, and OpenAI’s GPT model answers using the retrieved context (personal ChatGPT API required).
5. System accepts to natural language questions.
6. Returns a contextual, grounded response


## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repo and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/XYZZZZ/rag-psych-helper>
cd <rag-psych-helper>

#Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv rag_env
rag_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

#install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

#add your API key in a .env file (must be created by the user)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

#Run the script
python rag_project_psych.py

#You’ll be prompted to type a question:
## What is employee engagement?
## How do researchers measure consistency in survey design?

#Security Notes
The .env file is ignored via .gitignore
The .env file is not included as this is my personal API Key, create an .env file with the text 
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here" 
and save as a .env file to fully utilize the project. 

.env_example is included to guide API setup
